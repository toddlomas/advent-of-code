# Welcome to Todd's Advent Of Code 2022

- Code for this current years (2022) Advent Of Code, the advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

- **Python** will be used as first choice language, but would like to try **Javascript** too.

- This style of puzzle is new to me so, embarrasingly, solutions may be simple but I'm looking forward to seeing an improvement as the month of December goes on!

### Merry Christmas and happy coding!
